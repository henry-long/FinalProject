Part 2

For this lab, I attempted to code up the 3rd tutorial and understand 
what was happening in the lazyfoo SDL tutorial.

First of all, the program first initiliazes the SDL and we load up a media ( in my 
case I loaded up a bmp image I found online). I then created a boolean called quit 
which keeps track of if the user quit the program or not. I used that boolean to 
make a while loop to keep the window open as long as the user has not done any 
action to quit. We also keep track of user inputs with SDL Poll event. When the 
event que is a SDL_QUIT then the quit boolean becomes true and the while loop 
exits. At the end of hte loop we also draw the screen and update it.

Time log:

03/02/2016 - 1 hour - Began SDL Tutorial
03/10/2016 - 2 hour - Tried to install SDL locally on a Mac
03/16/2016 - 2 hour - Continued working on SDL
03/22/2016 - 2 hour - Continued with LazyFoo tutorials on student machines
03/23/2016 - 1 hour - Finished up a tutorial with interaction


Part 3
A main pitfall that I went through (thankfully it was mainly me in my group) was 
that at the beginning I spent a lot of time just trying to get SDL to work locally 
on my mac. I was quite stubborn about it and wanted to work on it at home with SSH 
and I kept on trying. But in the end, I realized it really wasn't worth my time so 
I just coded everything on one of the student machines. But with this I was able to 
tell my groupmates to simply forget about doing it locally and we all met up 
somewhere like the engineering library to work on things related to the project and 
we were able to move forward. As such, I was able to get through a couple tutorials 
while fully understanding the code and got a program that was interactive with SDL.
