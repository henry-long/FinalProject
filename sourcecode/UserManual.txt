User Manual

1. Special libraries needed to build/compile if personal machines were used

	Only the SDL library is required to build/compile the program. If SDL is already installed, our makefile will correctly use the libaries and compile the game.

2. Instructions on how to build/compile your program

	The program is compiled with the given makefile. It will compile the program into an executable. 	

3. User manual with how the controls/interactions work.

	The character is controlled with the arrow keys on the keyboard. This moves the character up, down, sideways, and diagonally depending on what key is pressed in what combination. To shoot a bullet, the user would press spacebar. If the character comes in contact with an enemy, the health bar will go down on the top left corner and when all the health is depleted, the game will end. The player can stay alive and beat the game by shooting bullets at the enemy which kills them. When all the enemies have died, the game is over and the player wins.

4. Known bugs.


5. Any other information that will inform the instructor and TAs for final grading.
